## 🌟 Key Features

*   **Premium Glass UI**: A pervasive "frosted glass" aesthetic with consistent transparency, blurs, and gradients across the sidebar, navigation, and content panels.

    *   🌙 **Midnight Mode**: Deep blue/slate tones.
    *   🖤 **OLED Mode**: True black optimization for high-contrast displays.
*   **Interactive Learning**:
    *   Smooth "scroll-to-top" navigation.
    *   Interactive Python terminal simulation.
    *   "Snake" game easter egg.
*   **Fully Responsive**: optimized for mobile (hamburger menu, scrollable sidebar) and desktop.
*   **Modern Tech Stack**: Pure HTML5, TailwindCSS (via CDN), and Vanilla JavaScript – no build steps required!

## 🎨 UI Philosophy
The design follows a "Liquid Glass" philosophy:
-   **Transparency**: Content floats on semi-transparent panels (`backdrop-filter: blur`).
-   **Mesh Gradients**: A fixed background mesh provides depth behind the glass.
-   **Funk**: High-visibility active states (the "Navigation Pill") use gradients and glow effects to pop.
